# Lightweight Asset Tracker (Streamlit & AI)

## Objective
Demonstrate rapid, AI-assisted development of internal operational tools. This project serves as an architectural equivalent to the **Microsoft Power Platform**, proving the ability to deploy lightweight user interfaces over relational databases to solve immediate business bottlenecks (e.g., equipment tracking and maintenance logging).

## Architecture Mapping & Tech Stack
While an enterprise might default to Microsoft licensing, this application achieves the exact same architectural flow using open-source, code-first frameworks:
* **Frontend Interface:** Streamlit (Architectural equivalent to Power Apps UI)
* **Backend Database:** SQLite (Architectural equivalent to Microsoft Dataverse)
* **Data Binding:** Pandas/Python (Architectural equivalent to Power Fx logic)

## Core Capabilities Developed
1. **Speed-to-Value:** Utilized AI-assisted coding principles to generate a fully functional application frontend and database schema in minutes rather than weeks.
2.  **State Management:** Implemented clear separation of concerns, routing user inputs securely into a localized relational database rather than a flat spreadsheet.
3. **Interactive UI/UX:** Built dynamic tabbed navigation, form validation, and real-time data table rendering that prioritizes high-urgency operational issues.
